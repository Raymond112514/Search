## Search algorithms

This repository contains an implementation of the search algorithm visualization. Two main classes are implemented: the environment class and the agent class. The environment class creates an environment that contains a target (red) and walls (black). The agent's goal is to interact with the environemnt and search for the target. Each agent has their own search method implemented. The environment class is implemented using the pygame module.
